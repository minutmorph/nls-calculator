# NLS Calculator Technical Demo

For some reason, Microsoft has removed the Calculator application from Windows, and our client wants a way to do basic arithmetic calculations. They would like this to be a desktop or web-based application.

## Installation/Deployment

Double-click or open "index.html" to run the calculator locally through your browser

or

Deploy to intranet/webserver and navigate to resrource through browser

## Developers

[https://jestjs.io/en/](Jest) is used for unit testing. To initiate tests, run 

```npm install```

After dependencies have been installed, run the tests using

```npm run test```

## Notes

This application runs on a single file for portability which seems appropriate for its use case and distribution requirements
